# Analyzing the Impact of Mobile Phone Usage on Student Health: A Data Mining and Machine Learning Approach  
## Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of mobile phone usage on the physical and mental health of students. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones in daily life, especially among students, it is crucial to understand how their use affects well-being. This analysis explores various factors including the frequency of phone usage, the types of activities students engage in on their phones (social media, gaming, educational apps, etc.), and how these correlate with health issues such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, eye strain, and physical inactivity. 

## Objectives
* Assess the correlation between mobile phone usage and student health issues such as eye strain, headaches, sleep disorders, anxiety, and stress.
* Identify the frequency and duration of mobile phone usage among students and the types of activities they engage in (academic vs. non-academic).
* Examine the long-term effects of excessive mobile phone usage on physical and mental health.
* Provide recommendations on healthy mobile phone usage habits for students.

## Expected Outcomes
* Understanding the impact of mobile phones on the health of students, including both negative and potentially positive aspects.
* Recommendations for reducing harmful effects, such as setting usage limits, taking regular breaks, and promoting healthy screen time habits.
* Strategies for educational institutions and policymakers to raise awareness about responsible mobile phone usage.
