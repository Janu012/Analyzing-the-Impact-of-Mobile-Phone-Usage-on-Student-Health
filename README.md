This project aims to investigate the impact of mobile phone usage on the physical, mental, and social health of students. It explores various dimensions such as sleep patterns, concentration levels, and the effects of prolonged screen time. The study also evaluates the behavioral changes caused by mobile phone addiction and proposes strategies to mitigate its negative effects

The widespread use of mobile phones among students offers educational benefits but also poses significant health risks, such as eye strain, mental stress, and sleep disturbances. 
This study investigates the correlation between mobile phone usage and student health, focusing on sleep patterns, concentration, and behavioral issues like phone addiction. 
Data collected through surveys and interviews revealed that excessive screen time disrupts sleep cycles, impairs focus, and increases stress levels. 
The findings emphasize the need for balanced mobile usage, proposing strategies such as usage limits, digital detoxes, and mindfulness practices to promote healthier habits among students.
